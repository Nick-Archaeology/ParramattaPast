# Parramatta Past
This project was created for a university project undertaken in August-October 2016 for a Masters of History project at the Australian National University. The associated Tumblr page has gone, but the map remains (https://nick-archaeology.github.io/ParramattaPast/). The map at present is limited in its usefulness, since the links are dead and some of the historic map overlays have stopped working. But it might be of interest to some and it represented an important step towards *Archaeology Near Me*. James Hodgkinson was my project partner.

The map overlays are still online at Map Warper:

- *Parramatta, parishes of St John & Field of Mars.* Probably printed between 1889 and 1894: http://mapwarper.net/maps/16011
- *Great Western Railway, Extension Parramatta to Penrith, 1858, Proclaimed Plan, Part 1*: http://mapwarper.net/maps/16009
